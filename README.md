# JamieHeather / Tube Storage Templates
## v1.3

To save myself the bother of re-making such templates in future (and perhaps some others as well!) I've left the raw templates that I use for keeping track of my freezer boxes here.

### Features
* 9x9 and 10x10 box templates
	* [14x14 added by request](https://github.com/JamieHeather/TubeStorageTemplates/issues/2)
* Fill tube details in column form; spreadsheet autopopulates a convenient tabulated version for easy printing
* Similarly auto-populating field names
* Auto-completed table section is protected to prevent accidental alterations

### Usage

* The way I use these files is to enter details of all tubes added to the boxes as I add them, removing them when I remove them. 
* Use of the list format makes typing and copying details across multiple entries easier, while using the two dimensional layout form makes it easier to print and annotate in the lab as I go (selecting the specific area to print, and scaling to fit 1 page). 
* I suggest putting these folders in a regularly backed up directory with version control, e.g. in a dropbox folder, as then previous versions will be saved too.

### Note
* **Do not cut and paste to move values on the left long table**. Doing so will break the spreadsheet's internal referencing.
* Changing the headers of the fields on the left long table will update the row-by-row headers on the right.
* The right hand fields are protected to prevent their editing, which would break the referencing. These can be edited by turning this protection off in Excel.
* These files have been tested in Excel on Windows and Mac OS X, and in LibreOffice Calc on Ubuntu Linux (but not very much).
